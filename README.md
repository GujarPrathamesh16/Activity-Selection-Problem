# Activity-Selection-Problem
This provides a solution to the Activity Selection Problem and follows Greedy approach for the solution.

#Explanation:
This project provides a solution for Activity Selection Problem using Greedy algorithmic approach. Greedy is a algorithmic approach which builds up solution piece by piece, these are chosen such that it is the most benificial approach, this provides a solution to optimization problems. In this aproach we make choice at every step that provides best solution at present and hence we get the optimal solution for complete problem.
In this Activity Selection Problem we were given a problem and were expected to select a
